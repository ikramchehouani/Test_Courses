            <p>Humans have marked their bodies with tattoos for thousands of years. These permanent designs—sometimes plain, sometimes elaborate, always personal—have served as amulets, status symbols, declarations of love, signs of religious beliefs, adornments and even forms of punishment. Joann Fletcher, research fellow in the department of archaeology at the University of York in Britain, describes the history of tattoos and their cultural significance to people around the world, from the famous " Iceman," a 5,200-year-old frozen mummy, to today’s Maori.</p>
            <p>In recent years, society has undergone a remarkable transformation regarding our views on tattoos. Those of us born in the 1980s or before have likely noticed this — tattoos were once a taboo here in America. They were hidden from parents. They had to be concealed from potential bosses. If you had any aspirations of an upper-class lifestyle, a visible tattoo would have served as a potential barrier to entry.Now, tattoos adorn the skin of around 40% of all Americans between the ages of 26 and 40. It is no surprise to see them on our bosses or our school teachers. Tattoos are now seen as a form of expression that is as valid as pierced ears or hairstyle. Just like pierced ears and hair, certain tattoos can still cause alarm, but they are far less likely to inspire a startled gasp than they once were.</p>
            <p>Tattoo culture around the world holds plenty of surprises for those who have grown up with the American interpretation.As we approach 300,000 successful laser tattoo removal treatments, MEDermis has expertise that no other tattoo removal clinic can come close to. We perform our successful removals by utilizing the most state-of-the-art laser technology designed specifically for tattoo removal.</p>

            <h2>The Polynesian "tatau", the origin of the word</h2>
            <p>Tattooing has been practiced in all parts of the world and in all eras. The origin of the word comes from Polynesia: the tatau is there a very important ancestral practice which could go back to - 1300 years BC.</p>

            <p>A rite during which we colored our skin during important stages of life using shark teeth and cut bones. It was also a social marker, because it was mainly practiced by the upper classes.As it turns out, a large part of Japan’s aversion to tattoos is thanks to the yakuza, or the Japanese mafia. Traditional Japanese tattooing is known as irezumi. The complexity of the Japanese relationship with tattoos begins in the 1600s, when the government enacted a policy that all criminals must be tattooed — an act known as bokkei. This would make it difficult for them to gain acceptance again in society. This policy of branding endured for over 200 years.</p>
            <p>And although it has long been assumed that such tattoos were the mark of prostitutes or were meant to protect the women against sexually transmitted diseases, I personally believe that the tattooing of ancient Egyptian women had a therapeutic role and functioned as a permanent form of amulet during the very difficult time of pregnancy and birth. This is supported by the pattern of distribution, largely around the abdomen, on top of the thighs and the breasts, and would also explain the specific types of designs, in particular the net-like distribution of dots applied over the abdomen. During pregnancy, this specific pattern would expand in a protective fashion in the same way bead nets were placed over wrapped mummies to protect them and "keep everything in." The placing of small figures of the household deity Bes at the tops of their thighs would again suggest the use of tattoos as a means of safeguarding the actual birth, since Bes was the protector of women in labor, and his position at the tops of the thighs a suitable location. This would ultimately explain tattoos as a purely female custom.</p>

            <h2>1891: invention of the electric tattoo machine</h2>
            <p>American tattoo artist Samuel O’Reilly is the first inventor of an electric tattoo machine. He was inspired by the electric pen, created a few years earlier by Thomas Edison, to which he added needles and a tube for inserting ink into the skin.</p>

            <p>The advent of the dermograph revolutionized the art of tattooing, making it possible to go much faster and to develop new techniques.</p>
            <p>It is possible that an implement best described as a sharp point set in a wooden handle, dated to c. 3000 B.C. and discovered by archaeologist W.M.F. Petrie at the site of Abydos may have been used to create tattoos. Petrie also found the aforementioned set of small bronze instruments c. 1450 B.C.—resembling wide, flattened needles—at the ancient town site of Gurob. If tied together in a bunch, they would provide repeated patterns of multiple dots.These instruments are also remarkably similar to much later tattooing implements used in 19th-century Egypt. The English writer William Lane (1801-1876) observed, "the operation is performed with several needles (generally seven) tied together: with these the skin is pricked in a desired pattern: some smoke black (of wood or oil), mixed with milk from the breast of a woman, is then rubbed in.It is generally performed at the age of about 5 or 6 years, and by gipsy.</p>
